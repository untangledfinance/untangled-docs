# Handling Outliers and Imbalanced Data

#### Handling Outliers and **Imbalanced Data**

* **Outlier Detection**
  * Statistical methods: Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), box plots, and scatter plots.
  * Machine learning-based methods: isolation forests, DBSCAN, and one-class SVM
* **Outlier Treatment**
  * Strategies for handling outliers: trimming, winsorization, transformation, and removing outliers based on domain knowledge.
* **Imbalanced Data Handling**
  * Techniques to address class imbalance: resampling methods (oversampling, undersampling), synthetic data generation (SMOTE), and cost-sensitive learning.
