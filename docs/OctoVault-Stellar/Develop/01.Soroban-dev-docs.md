## Usage

1. **Initialize Vault:** Use the `initialize` function to set up the vault with an offer.
2. **Deposit Tokens:** Buyers can deposit tokens using the `deposit` function.
3. **Update Price:** Sellers can update the offer price using the `updt_price` function.
4. **Redeem Shares:** Users can submit redemption requests with the `redeem_request` function.
5. **Cancel Requests:** Users can cancel redemption requests using the `cancel_request` function.
6. **Claim Requests:** Users can claim redeemed tokens after the epoch is settled using the `claim_request` function.
7. **Settle Epoch:** The treasury can settle the epoch using the `setle_epoch` function.

## Key Features

- **Epoch-based Settlement:** The contract operates on epochs, allowing for batch processing of redemption requests.
- **Automatic Price Conversion:** Token amounts are calculated based on the current price with 6 decimal precision.
- **Authorization Control:** All functions require proper authorization from the appropriate parties.
- **Event Logging:** All critical operations emit events for transparency and auditability.
- **Safe Arithmetic:** Uses `checked_add`, `checked_mul`, and `unwrap_optimized` to prevent overflows.

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive tests in the `test.rs` file, covering all major functionalities such as initialization, deposits, price updates, redemption requests, and epoch settlements.

## Security Considerations

This contract implements several security measures:

- **Authorization:** All functions require proper user authentication via `require_auth()`.
- **Input Validation:** Prevents zero prices and validates all input parameters.
- **Safe Arithmetic:** Uses checked arithmetic operations to prevent overflows.
- **Event Emissions:** Provides transparency through comprehensive event logging.
- **Epoch Management:** Ensures proper sequencing of redemption and settlement operations.

This contract is designed to provide secure and transparent token management. It ensures that all operations are authorized and that no party can perform actions without proper permissions. Proper use of this contract requires familiarity with the Soroban SDK and token transfer mechanisms.
