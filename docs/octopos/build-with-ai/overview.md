# Build with AI

Use OctoPos with LLMs, AI agents, and coding tools. The OctoPos API is public, read-only, and stable on the [EVM surface](../octopos-evm/overview). The Stellar surface exposes a public read API plus a paid subscriber tier for background tracking — see [Subscriptions](https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/defi-positions-api/subscriptions) on the Stellar side.

## Quick endpoint guide for agents

The fastest way to get a useful response from OctoPos is to call one of these endpoints directly. They are public, require no API key, and return JSON that LLMs parse well.

| Task | Surface | Method + Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get a wallet's token balances | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/balances/:address` | Defaults to 13 chains. Pass `chain_ids` to scope. |
| Get a wallet's stablecoin balances | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/stablecoins/:address` | Stablecoin-only filter on balances. |
| Get a wallet's DeFi positions | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/defi/positions/:address` | Ethereum only. Aave V2/V3, Compound V3, Uniswap V2/V3, Curve, Lido, Maker, Balancer, Morpho, Sky, Pendle, Yearn, Euler, Stader. |
| Get raw activity (transfers, swaps, mints, burns) | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/activity/:address` | Filter by `activity_type` and `asset_type`. |
| Get raw transactions with 4byte decode | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/transactions/:address` | Cheaper than `/activity` for the same address. |
| List supported chains | EVM | `GET /v1/evm/supported-chains` | Returns per-chain `supported` flags. |
| Get a Stellar wallet's positions | Stellar | `GET /v1/positions/{address}` | Blend, Aquarius, SoroSwap, Phoenix, FxDAO, Untangled Vault, native XLM. |
| Get a Stellar wallet's contracts | Stellar | `GET /v1/contracts/{address}` | Per-protocol position breakdown. |
| Health check | both | `GET /v1/health` (Stellar) / `GET /healthz` (EVM) | Use to verify a base URL is up. |

`chain_ids` is numeric for EVM (1 = Ethereum, 137 = Polygon, etc.). For the full table, see [Supported chains](../octopos-evm/supported-chains).

For the full per-endpoint catalog, see the [Agent Reference](./agent-reference).

## Use with LLMs

### Complete documentation for LLMs

A single `llms-full.txt` file containing every page on `docs.crediolabs.ai` in plain text, optimised for LLM ingestion — to be updated.

If you need the file before it lands, concatenate every page under `/docs/octopos/` and `/docs/octopos/octopos-evm/` from the public site.

### Per-page access

Append `.md` to any page URL to retrieve the Markdown source. For example:
```
https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/octopos-evm/capabilities
```

## OpenAPI specifications

The Stellar API exposes its full OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec at:
```
GET https://api-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/openapi.json
```

The EVM API does not yet publish an OpenAPI spec — to be updated. Until then, the per-endpoint reference on this site is the source of truth (see [Capabilities](../octopos-evm/capabilities) and the [Agent Reference](./agent-reference)).

For a generated client, the stellar `openapi.json` works out of the box with `openapi-generator`, `orval`, and similar tools. EVM client generation requires hand-written types until the spec lands.

## Add docs to your AI tool

OctoPos can be added as a documentation source in Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI coding tools that support doc indexing. The exact mechanism for each tool is to be updated.

General pattern across tools:
1. Open the tool's documentation or context settings
2. Add `https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos` as a documentation source
3. Reference it in chats with a custom handle (e.g., `@octopos-docs`)

Tool-specific notes:
- **Cursor** — Settings → Features → Docs
- **Claude Code** — add to your project's `CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` documentation list
- **Other** — any tool that accepts an HTTPS documentation URL will work

## AI search

The "Ask AI" button in the site header is to be updated. Until then, the in-page search at the top of the sidebar indexes every page on the site.

## What about MCP?

OctoPos is being designed as **agent-native** — the [Credio Agents](https://crediolabs.ai) (a separate product line) consume OctoPos as a data substrate via the upcoming MCP server. The MCP server is to be updated.

If you want to integrate today, call the REST endpoints directly. The API is stable, public, and JSON-native, which is the right shape for agent tool calls.
