# Agent Reference

A dense, copy-friendly reference for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, and similar tools) integrating against OctoPos.

The full text of this page is the canonical reference. If you want it as a single plain-text file for LLM ingestion, see [Build with AI](./overview) — `llms-full.txt` is to be updated.

## Authentication

**EVM surface** — public, no authentication. All endpoints accept requests without headers.

**Stellar surface** — public read endpoints (`/v1/positions/:address`, `/v1/contracts/:address`, `/v1/protocols`) accept requests without authentication. Endpoints that read subscriber-only data (`/v1/keys/me/*`, `/v1/subscription/*`) require an API key. The key is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for authenticated requests, and HMAC-signed for webhooks. See [Subscriptions](https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/defi-positions-api/subscriptions).

**x402** — for metered access on the Stellar side, the API responds with `402 Payment Required` and a payment challenge when an unauthenticated request hits a paid endpoint. The client pays the challenge (USDC on Base) and retries. x402 is supported out of the box — no SDK needed.

## Base URLs

```
# Stellar API (production)
https://api-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai

# EVM API (production)
https://api-evm-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai

# Brand fallback (same bundles, different zone)
https://api-octopos-mainnet.untangled.finance
https://api-evm-octopos-mainnet.untangled.finance
```

Stellar paths are mounted under `/v1/*`. EVM paths are also under `/v1/*`. Both APIs are HTTPS only.

For full per-endpoint docs: [DeFi Positions API (Stellar)](https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/defi-positions-api/intro).

## Webhooks

Both surfaces support webhooks for change notifications.

**EVM** — POST to `/v1/evm/subscriptions` with `{ address, chain_ids, webhook_url, event_types }`. Signed with HMAC-SHA256, retries with exponential backoff.

**Stellar** — POST to `/v1/webhooks/{goldsky,slack,x402}`. See [Stellar deployment docs](https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/defi-positions-api/subscriptions).

## Pagination

To be updated. EVM endpoints accept `offset` and `limit` query params; default `limit=100`, max `1000` for balances, `100` for activity, `100` for transactions. The API does not return a cursor — concatenate until you receive fewer items than the limit, or until a `next_offset` field is included in the response (planned).

## Error handling

To be updated. The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | Success | Parse the response body. |
| `400` | Malformed request | Check query params, address format, chain_ids. |
| `402` | Payment required (Stellar paid endpoints) | Resolve the x402 challenge and retry. |
| `404` | Address has no activity on any supported chain | Treat as empty portfolio. |
| `429` | Rate limited | Back off and retry after `Retry-After` header. |
| `500` | Upstream RPC failure | Retry with backoff; one or more chain RPCs may be down. |
| `503` | Worker isolate restarting | Retry; transient. |

## Compute units / quota

To be updated. EVM API rate limits are in-memory and reset on Worker isolate restart. There is no published CU cost model. Stellar API uses HMAC key lookup with short-TTL KV cache; subscriber-tier requests are billed by x402 payment, public read endpoints are unmetered.

## Chain reference (EVM)

16 supported chains, 9 deferred. The full table is on [OctoPos EVM supported chains](../octopos-evm/supported-chains). Quick reference for the 13 default-tag chains that `/v1/evm/balances` expands to without `chain_ids`:

| Chain ID | Name |
|---|---|
| 1 | Ethereum |
| 10 | OP Mainnet |
| 56 | BNB Smart Chain |
| 100 | Gnosis |
| 137 | Polygon |
| 324 | zkSync Era |
| 999 | HyperEVM |
| 8453 | Base |
| 42161 | Arbitrum One |
| 42220 | Celo |
| 43114 | Avalanche C-Chain |
| 81457 | Blast |
| 7777777 | Zora (balances only, no DeFi positions) |

## Protocol reference (Stellar)

| Protocol | Adapter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Blend | Lending | All pools, all position types. Health factor with per-pool reserve factors. |
| Aquarius | AMM | LP positions, CLPs, staking. |
| SoroSwap | AMM | LP positions. |
| Phoenix | AMM | LP positions. |
| FxDAO | Vault | Stablecoin vault shares. |
| Untangled Vault | ERC-4626 vault | Share balance, NAV-based pricing. |
| Untangled Loop | Leveraged positions | Synthetic long/short on Blend + Aquarius. |
| Native XLM | Wallet | All trustline assets. |

## Response shapes

To be updated. Representative shapes:

**EVM `/v1/evm/balances/:address`** — see [OctoPos EVM capabilities](../octopos-evm/capabilities#v1evmbalancesaddress).

**Stellar `/v1/positions/:address`** — see [DeFi Positions API (Stellar)](https://docs.untangled.finance/docs/octopos/defi-positions-api/intro).

## Common workflows

### Combined Stellar + EVM portfolio

OctoPos is the only API that returns normalised positions for both a Stellar `G...` address and an EVM `0x...` address in the same response shape. The use case: a wallet that holds a user's Stellar and EVM activity in one view.

```bash
# Stellar positions
curl https://api-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/positions/GABC.../summary

# EVM positions
curl https://api-evm-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/evm/balances/0x...?chain_ids=1

# Both responses carry a `total_usd` field; sum them client-side for a unified portfolio.
```

To be updated: a single endpoint that takes both addresses and returns one merged position view.

### Real-time activity feed for an EVM address

```bash
# Recent token swaps, top 10
curl 'https://api-evm-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/evm/activity/0x...?activity_type=swap&limit=10'
```

### Subscribe to balance changes

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-evm-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/evm/subscriptions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "address": "0x...",
    "chain_ids": [1],
    "webhook_url": "https://your.app/hook",
    "event_types": ["balance_change"]
  }'
```

### Cross-check a Stellar address against on-chain reality

```bash
curl https://api-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai/v1/positions/GABC.../contracts
# Returns per-protocol breakdown: which Blend pool, which Aquarius LP, etc.
```

## Rules

**Always:**
- Pass `chain_ids` explicitly when calling `/v1/evm/balances` to avoid scanning all 13 default-tag chains.
- URL-encode the path (use `%20` for spaces in `/v1/evm/balances/0x...` is N/A; the address is hex). Spaces only matter in query string values.
- Use the right base URL: `api-evm-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai` for EVM, `api-octopos-mainnet.crediolabs.ai` for Stellar.

**Ask first:**
- Whether the DeFi positions endpoint (Ethereum only) covers the chain you need. Multi-chain DeFi is not yet supported.
- Whether the address has been seen before — first-time queries are slower (live fetch from RPC).

**Never:**
- Construct manual offsets. The pagination model is to be updated; for now, request `limit=1000` and stop when fewer items return.
- Assume chain names are accepted in `chain_ids`. Use numeric IDs only (`1`, `137`, `42161`).
- Call the EVM API from a browser without checking CORS first.

## What this API does NOT support

- No writes. OctoPos is read-only — there is no way to send a transaction, sign a message, or move funds via OctoPos. Use the protocol's own UI or a wallet.
- No WebSockets. Streaming is via NDJSON HTTP responses on the Stellar side (`/v1/streaming/:address/history`).
- No ENS / SNS / human-readable name resolution. Pass raw addresses.
- No on-chain transaction broadcasting on the EVM side. (The Stellar API exposes `POST /v1/txb/simulate` for simulation only.)
- No real-time push updates. Subscribe to webhooks and consume HTTP POSTs.
