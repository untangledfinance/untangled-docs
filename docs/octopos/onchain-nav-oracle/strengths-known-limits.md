# Strengths & Known Limits

## Strengths

- **Per-adapter error isolation.** A single failing protocol cannot zero out the entire NAV.
- **Pluggable adapters.** New protocols ship as standalone contracts; PositionRegistry needs no changes.
- **Two-step admin handover** plus per-adapter timelock guards against fat-finger mistakes.
- **Alias keys** keep dashboards and integrations friendly without giving up the strict address-keyed feeds.
- **Reconciles to within ~0.25%** of the off-chain reference (OctoPos).

## Known Limits

- **`compute_nav` exceeds the 100M instruction budget** at 3 adapters; per-adapter calls are the only stable path today.
- **SpokeReporter not yet deployed on mainnet** — contract is built and verified on testnet, but cross-chain NAV publishing is gated on mainnet deploy + keeper wallet funding.
- **Older OracleRegistry deployments are deprecated** — `CDC2QIOCUFM35M64HT4HLP2GN3USNERPEGUKOYOSMDPR7XUAUGFA7FKY` (pre-alias) and `CD7CH3RJZVMVZWK5AUWUHUARRIRD6DQVKANPPPXQRWUGGJZVOPDD5LAI` (pre `set_oracle_for_asset`) are not used by any live caller.
