# OctoVault NAV — Stellar System Report

**Mainnet, May 2026.** End-to-end on-chain NAV for OctoVault on Stellar.

## 1. System Overview

OctoVault NAV computes the **Net Asset Value (NAV)** of any vault account on Stellar, fully on-chain. NAV equals the sum of all priced assets the account holds across supported DeFi protocols, minus its outstanding liabilities. Values are denominated in USDC (6-decimal scale).

**Why on-chain.** Off-chain NAV oracles (such as OctoPos) are useful for dashboards, but cross-chain settlement, liquidations, and policy-driven actions need a value that smart contracts can verify themselves. OctoVault's stack delivers the same value as OctoPos with a verifiable on-chain path.

**Status today.** Live on Stellar mainnet. Three protocol adapters are wired up (DirectHoldings, Blend, Aquarius) and the NAV reconciles against OctoPos within ~0.25%.
