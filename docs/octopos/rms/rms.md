# Risk Monitoring Service (RMS)

NOTE: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE DEVELOPED AS PART OF A HACKATHON AND NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. FURTHER UPDATES TO FOLLOW.

## Overview

The Risk Monitoring Service continuously evaluates lending, AMM, and DeFi positions across multiple protocols for risk conditions. RMS supports:

- **Blend Capital** — Lending pool positions (SUPPLY, BORROW)
- **Aquarius AMM** — Liquidity pool positions (LP)
- **SoroSwap** — Factory-created pair positions (LP)
- **Phoenix DeFi Hub** — Staking and LP positions (STAKE, LP)
- **FxDAO** — Collateral debt positions (COLLATERAL, BORROW)
- **Untangled Vaults** — ERC-4626 vault positions (SUPPLY)

When a position crosses configured thresholds, RMS triggers notifications and can provide transaction proposals for risk mitigation.

## Risk Levels

| Level | Health Factor | Severity | Action |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
| `healthy` | ≥ 1.50 | LOW | HOLD — No action needed |
| `warn` | 1.25 – 1.50 | MEDIUM | WATCH — Monitor closely |
| `alert` | 1.10 – 1.25 | HIGH | REPAY — Consider repaying debt |
| `emergency` | < 1.10 | CRITICAL | LIQUIDATE — Position at risk |

## Risk Triggers

### Health Factor Triggers
- **`low_health_factor`** — Health factor has dropped below the configured threshold

### Oracle Triggers
- **`oracle_stale`** — Price oracle data is outdated (configurable age threshold)
- **`oracle_price_manipulation`** — Detected potential price manipulation
- **`oracle_feed_divergence`** — Price feeds are providing inconsistent data
- **`oracle_address_changed`** — Oracle address has changed unexpectedly

### Pool Triggers
- **`pool_utilization_high`** — Pool utilization exceeds safe limits (>80%)
- **`pool_freeze`** — Pool operations have been paused by admin

### Collateral Triggers
- **`collateral_depeg`** — Collateral asset losing peg stability
- **`collateral_liquidity_low`** — Insufficient liquidity for liquidation
- **`collateral_oracle_sanity_fail`** — Collateral price failed sanity checks

### Advanced Triggers
- **`borrow_apr_spike`** — Borrow rate increased significantly (>50% change)
- **`twap_deviation_exceeded`** — TWAP has deviated beyond safe limits
- **`vwap_manipulation`** — VWAP suggests potential manipulation
- **`single_trade_impact`** — Single large trade had outsized price impact

## Configuration

### Default Thresholds

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Health Factor Warn | 1.50 | Alert when HF drops below this |
| Health Factor Alert | 1.25 | Action recommended below this |
| Health Factor Emergency | 1.10 | Immediate action below this |
| Oracle Max Age | 300s | Max age before oracle marked stale |
| Utilization Warn | 80% | High utilization warning threshold |
| Utilization Alert | 90% | High utilization critical threshold |

### User Configuration

Users can customize their risk thresholds per wallet:

```json
{
  "walletAddress": "GABC...XYZ",
  "thresholds": {
    "hfWarnOverride": 1.60,
    "hfAlertOverride": 1.30,
    "hfEmergencyOverride": 1.15,
    "oracleWarnAge": 180,
    "utilWarnBps": 7500,
    "utilAlertBps": 8500
  }
}
```

## Health Factor Calculation

Health Factor is calculated as:

```
Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Collateral Factor) / Liability Value
```

### Example

| Asset | Value (USD) | Factor |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| USDC Collateral | $10,000 | 0.90 |
| USDC Debt | $5,000 | — |

```
Health Factor = (10000 × 0.90) / 5000 = 1.80
```

### Liquidation Threshold

A position enters liquidation when:

```
Health Factor < 1.10
```

At this point, liquidators can repay the debt and claim collateral at a bonus.

## Real-Time Monitoring

RMS runs a continuous evaluation loop across all supported protocols:

| Interval | Task |
|----------|------|
| 60 seconds | Fetch positions from all protocols for tracked wallets |
| 60 seconds | Evaluate each position against thresholds |
| On change | Trigger notifications if risk level changed |
| 15 minutes | Cooldown between repeated alerts |

---

## Integration with TxB

When a risk alert is triggered, RMS can coordinate with the Transaction Builder to propose exit strategies:

1. **REPAY** — Build a repay transaction to improve health factor
2. **LIQUIDATE** — For liquidators: build a liquidation transaction
3. **UNWIND** — Build a complete position close transaction

See [Transaction Builder](https://docs.crediolabs.ai/docs/Credio%20Agents/8.%20txb) for details on building transactions.
