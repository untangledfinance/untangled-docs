# Introduction to OctoPos

## What is OctoPos?

**OctoPos** is a comprehensive DeFi intelligence platform for the Stellar blockchain. It provides real-time position tracking, risk monitoring, and transaction execution services for users interacting with Stellar DeFi protocols.

OctoPos is part of the Untangled Finance ecosystem — the data backbone that powers OctoVault's real-time NAV calculations, portfolio analytics, and risk management.

## Core Services

### 1. Position Tracker
Tracks user positions across multiple Stellar DeFi protocols with real-time pricing.

### 2. Risk Monitoring Service (RMS)
Continuously monitors lending, AMM, and DeFi positions across Blend, Aquarius, SoroSwap, Phoenix, FxDAO, and other protocols for risk conditions and triggers alerts when thresholds are crossed. -> (To be updated)

### 3. Transaction Builder (TxB)
Builds optimized Stellar Soroban transactions for position exits (repay, liquidate, unwind). -> (To be updated)

### 4. Notification Service (NS)
Delivers risk alerts to users via Telegram, Discord, and Email. ->(To be updated)

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-protocol aggregation** — Tracks positions across Blend, Aquarius, SoroSwap, Phoenix, FxDAO, and native Stellar wallets in a single query
- **6-feed price priority chain** — Aquarius AMM → Wrapped Assets → Blend Oracle → StellarExpert → DeFiLlama → Untangled Vault NAV, with automatic fallback and cross-validation
- **Real-time tracking** — 60-second position collection loop with raw snapshots, hourly OHLC, and daily OHLC rollups
- **Risk monitoring** — Continuous evaluation of positions across multiple protocols with configurable thresholds
- **Transaction building** — Build repay, liquidation, and unwind transactions with slippage control
- **Multi-channel alerts** — Telegram, Discord, and Email notifications for risk events

## Architecture Overview

OctoPos consists of four interconnected services:
