# OctoPos EVM — Supported Chains

**V8.3 (2026-06-19).** 16 chains supported; 9 chains deferred due to missing public infrastructure.

## 16 supported chains

| Chain ID | Name | Native Token | Support Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ethereum | ETH | **Full** (DeFi + balances) | All 17 adapters active |
| 10 | OP Mainnet | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 56 | BNB Smart Chain | BNB | Balances + wallet | — |
| 100 | Gnosis | XDAI | Balances + wallet | — |
| 137 | Polygon | MATIC | Balances + wallet | — |
| 250 | Fantom | FTM | Balances + wallet | — |
| 324 | zkSync Era | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 8453 | Base | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 42161 | Arbitrum One | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 43114 | Avalanche C-Chain | AVAX | Balances + wallet | — |
| 42220 | Celo | CELO | Balances + wallet | — |
| 81457 | Blast | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 59144 | Linea | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 534352 | Scroll | ETH | Balances + wallet | — |
| 5000 | Mantle | MNT | Balances + wallet | — |
| 999 | HyperEVM | HYPE | Balances + wallet (native only) | No Blockscout v2 — ERC-20 discovery not available |

:::note
The `/v1/evm/balances` endpoint defaults to the **13-chain default tag** (the same chains Dune Sim's `default` tag expands to: Ethereum, Optimism, BNB, Gnosis, Polygon, zkSync, HyperEVM, Base, Arbitrum, Celo, Avalanche, Blast, Zora). The other 3 chains (Fantom, Linea, Scroll, Mantle) are addressable by explicit `chain_ids`. Zora (7777777) is omitted from the positions route — its DeFi ecosystem is too thin — but is reachable via `/v1/evm/balances` for ERC-20 discovery.
:::

## What "Full" vs "Balances + wallet" means

- **Full (Ethereum only)** — `GET /v1/evm/positions/:chainId/:address` returns DeFi protocol positions (Aave, Compound, Uniswap, etc.) **plus** token balances. The DeFi adapter pipeline is active.
- **Balances + wallet (15 other chains)** — Positions route returns native balance + top ERC-20s. The DeFi adapter layer is Ethereum-only; protocol positions on other chains return zero.

## 9 deferred chains

These chains are supported by DeBank but lack public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama coverage. OctoPos does not index them. Revisit quarterly as paid infrastructure or self-hosted nodes become available.

| Chain ID | Name | Reason for deferral |
|---|---|---|
| 4200 | Merlin | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 223 | B² | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 4102 | Sonic | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 25 | Cronos | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 1116 | Core | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 8217 | Kaia | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 1088 | Metis | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 34443 | Mode | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |
| 167000 | Taiko | No public Blockscout / RPC / DefiLlama |

## Per-chain token discovery

Token discovery (finding what ERC-20s a wallet holds) uses two sources:

1. **Blockscout v2** — free public API, primary source for most chains
2. **Top-tokens multicall** — hand-curated ~80 tokens + viem `balanceOf`, Ethereum-only fallback

| Chain | Blockscout | Top-Tokens Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | `eth.blockscout.com` | yes |
| Polygon | `polygon.blockscout.com` | — |
| Arbitrum | `arbitrum.blockscout.com` | — |
| BNB | `bscscan.com` (Etherscan family) | — |
| Gnosis | `gnosis.blockscout.com` | — |
| Celo | `celo.blockscout.com` | — |
| zkSync | `explorer.zksync.io` (native) | — |
| Base | falls back to `eth.blockscout.com` (over-reports ETH) | — |
| Optimism | falls back to `eth.blockscout.com` (over-reports ETH) | — |
| Avalanche | falls back to `eth.blockscout.com` (no dedicated instance) | — |
| Blast | falls back to `eth.blockscout.com` (no dedicated instance) | — |
| HyperEVM | No public instance | — |
| Zora | No public instance | — |

:::warning
**Base, Optimism, Avalanche, Blast — known data quality issue.** These chains do not have reliable per-chain Blockscout instances. The route falls back to `eth.blockscout.com`, which returns **Ethereum** token holdings but reports them under the queried chain. This causes 2–4× over-counting of ETH holdings on these chains. If your use case requires accurate per-chain ERC-20 attribution, treat Base/Optimism/Avalanche/Blast holdings as a lower bound, not a precise total.
:::

:::warning
**HyperEVM and Zora — no Blockscout at all.** Only the native token balance is returned. ERC-20 discovery is not available on these chains.
