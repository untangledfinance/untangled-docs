# Protocol overview (whitepaper)
Untangled Protocol is a decentralized funding and liquidity protocol that bridges crypto liquidity pools with real world assets (RWA).  RWA collaterals, once tokenized into NFTs, can be refinanced or packaged in a seamless way, without any frictions. Investors hold note tokens which represent interests in cash flows from collateral pools. 
Untangled has developed a liquidation mechanism. If asset quality within a collateral pool deteriorated below a certain threshold, the liquidation process would be triggered. Relevant collaterals would be auctioned - either on-chain or off-chain - to repay investors. When assets are performing and investors would like to exit for liquidity reasons, the protocol facilitates a on-chain Dutch auction that helps new investors take over the exited portion.
Two applications have been developed on Untangled Protocol: Binkabi 'originate' assets and Untangled Finance"distribute' them. An independent security audit has also been completed for Untangled Protocol's smart contracts. 
## Tokenization revolution
### Merging TradFi and DeFi
The retrenchment of traditional banks from the SME markets to focus on their largest clients has created a funding gap in the trillions to underserved SMEs and financially excluded consumers. This has enabled a new asset class of fintech lending, i.e. tech-enabled specialist lenders, to grow exponentially. 
Fundraise through securitisation is complex and expensive with multiple service providers involved. The lack of transparency also adds a risk premium for originators. Alternative lenders and fintechs, typically with under $30m portfolios, find it difficult to access capital markets.
Legacy systems of transferring value are slow, cumbersome and laden with friction and inefficiencies. Just as the internet was transformative for the mobility of information, digital assets will be revolutionary for the way in which value is transferred. We are witnessing entirely new financial rails being engineered and for the first time being able to handle users at scale.
Extending DeFi lending collateral universe
The current crypto lending is mostly collateralised by native crypto assets. This excludes a vast majority of borrowers and projects from accessing crypto credit, particularly those financing real world assets such as renewable energy projects or trade finance.

Value locked in DeFi has been limited to crypto. In order to grow, diversify and be regulatory-proof, Defi needs to tap into the multi-trillion dollar real world assets where businesses such as SMEs in global trade have a real need for capital such as:
Trade finance solutions involving multinationals trading with emerging markets suppliers 
Revenue-based financing for on-chain and off-chain records of activities 
Fintech capital for both consumer and SME borrowers 
Green financing schemes such as renewable energy, urban mobility or sustainable agriculture.
