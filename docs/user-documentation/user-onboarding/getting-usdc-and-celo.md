# Getting USDC and CELO
## On-ramping from fiat
To start investing in the Untangled Protocol pools, you'll need two types of digital assets: USDC and CELO. Here's a step-by-step guide to acquiring these assets, specifically tailored for newcomers to the blockchain space.

- **USDC (USD Coin)**: A stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US Dollar and issued by Circle. It's available on various blockchains, but for the Untangled Protocol, which operates on the Solana blockchain, you need USDC issued on the Celo blockchain, referred to as "Celo USDC".

- **CELO**: The native currency of the Celo blockchain, used to pay transaction fees (commonly known as gas fees).

For those new to cryptocurrencies, we recommend using a centralized exchange, as they offer a user-friendly interface and direct support. Below are instructions for purchasing USDC and CELO on some of the most popular exchanges.

## Bridging and Converting Digital Assets to the Celo Network

For users who already familiar with crypto currency and have their asset on other network like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, etc. we suggested that you should use [**Squid Router**](https://app.squidrouter.com/) or [**PortalBridge by Wormhole**](https://portalbridge.com/) to transfer your asset to Celo Network.

### Using Squid Router

Squid Router allows you to bridge assets from other networks to the Celo network and offers the option to swap these assets to CELO during the bridging process. 

Example of Swapping USDC from [**Ethereum to Celo USDC**](https://app.squidrouter.com/?chains=1%2C42220&tokens=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48%2C0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C): 

- Access Squid Router: Navigate to the Squid Router interface.
- Connect Your Wallet: Ensure your wallet is connected and set to the Ethereum network.
- Select Assets: Choose USDC on Ethereum as the asset you want to bridge.
- Swap and Bridge: Opt to swap your Ethereum-based USDC to Celo-native USDC during the transfer process.
- Confirm and Execute: Review the transaction details, including any fees, and execute the transfer.

Example of Swapping ETH from [**Ethereum to CELO on Celo**](https://app.squidrouter.com/?chains=1%2C42220&tokens=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE%2C0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438):

- Start at Squid Router: Open the Squid Router platform.
- Connect Wallet: Make sure your wallet is active and on the Ethereum network.
- Choose to Swap: Select ETH for swapping.
- Set Destination: Choose CELO on the Celo network as the target asset.
- Complete the Swap: Confirm all details and perform the swap.

### Using PortalBridge by Wormhole

PortalBridge by Wormhole facilitates the transfer of assets by wrapping them into a Wormhole-wrapped token on the destination chain, which can then be converted to native tokens. 

Example of [**Converting Wormhole-Wrapped USDC to Celo Native USDC**](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?inputCurrency=0x37f750B7cC259A2f741AF45294f6a16572CF5cAd&outputCurrency=0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C&chain=celo):

- Access PortalBridge: Go to the PortalBridge platform.
- Connect Your Wallet: Connect your wallet that holds the assets on the original network.
- Initiate the Transfer: Choose USDC and the network itâ€™s currently on (e.g., Ethereum).
- Receive Wrapped Token: Complete the transfer to receive Wormhole-wrapped USDC on the Celo network.
- Swap on Uniswap: Go to Uniswap, connect your wallet set to the Celo network, and swap your wrapped USDC for Celo-native USDC.

Example of Swapping ETH on Ethereum to CELO on Celo:
- Visit PortalBridge: Open the PortalBridge interface.
- Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure your wallet is connected to the Ethereum network.
- Transfer ETH: Send ETH and receive it as a Wormhole-wrapped token on the Celo network.
- Swap Wrapped ETH for CELO: Use a platform like Uniswap to swap your wrapped ETH to CELO.
