# Introduction

Untangled Protocol is a decentralized funding and liquidity protocol that bridges crypto liquidity pools with real world assets (RWA).  RWA collaterals, once tokenized into NFTs, can be refinanced or packaged in a seamless way, without any frictions. Investors hold note tokens which represent interests in cash flows from collateral pools. 

Untangled has developed a liquidation mechanism. If asset quality within a collateral pool deteriorated below a certain threshold, the liquidation process would be triggered. Relevant collaterals would be auctioned - either on-chain or off-chain - to repay investors. When assets are performing and investors would like to exit for liquidity reasons, the protocol facilitates a on-chain Dutch auction that helps new investors take over the exited portion.

Two applications have been developed on Untangled Protocol: **Binkabi** 'originate' assets and **Untangled Finance** "distribute' them. An independent security audit has also been completed for Untangled Protocol's smart contracts.
