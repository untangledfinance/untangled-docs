# Introduction

Untangled is a RWA credit infrastructure project that facilitates the tokenization, issuance, investment, monitoring, and redemption of RWAs on the blockchain. 

Our mission is to bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi, making private credit, previously accessible only to large financial institutions, available to DeFi investors worldwide in a risk-adjusted manner. By doing so, we enhance access to private credit for DeFi investors and simultaneously broaden financing avenues for the backbones of economic growth—SMEs, providing them with more diverse funding options beyond traditional channels.

## Assets and Structure

Untangled collaborates with financial institutions like Fasnara and has access to over 140 fintech lenders, each vetted and funded through a comprehensive six to eight-month due diligence process. This rigorous evaluation ensures that assets brought on-chain are of institutional quality.
Each investment pool is linked to a real-world securitization vehicle based in Luxembourg, a structure that has been established and trusted in TradFi for decades. Assets within the pool are completely ring-fenced from the originator’s balance sheet, enhancing investor security and protection.
On-chain securitization allows for the pooling of a diverse portfolio of assets—from SME loans to receivables—into structured products that can be segmented according to risk and return profiles. This granularity enables investors to tailor their investments precisely, aligning their risk tolerance and investment objectives with specific segments of an asset pool.

## Credit Oracle Infrastructure

The RWA DeFi sector has experienced a high rate of defaults due to a lack of robust credit risk management and monitoring tools. Untangled is addressing this challenge by pioneering a decentralized Credit Oracle Infrastructure. By leveraging both on-chain and off-chain data, along with zero-knowledge proof technology and AI, this infrastructure delivers real-time credit pricing data. This enhances the ability of protocols and investors to dynamically manage risks. For more information, visit: RWA Wise. 

## Our Vision

Untangled is committed to enhancing the DeFi ecosystem by introducing institutional-grade private credit assets into the blockchain space. We offer investors a unique opportunity to engage with vetted, high-quality assets, ensuring a secure investment environment with optimized risk-adjusted returns. 

## How It Works

Untangled utilizes a sophisticated on-chain securitization structure that adheres to stringent legal frameworks in Luxembourg. This structure ensures the highest degree of security and transparency, with assets fully ring-fenced from originators' balance sheets. Our pools are backed by a diverse portfolio of French SME working capital loans, sourced and originated by our trusted fintech partner, Karmen.
Each investment pool targets specific financial thresholds and returns, with our initial offerings aiming for a debt ceiling of $5 million USDC and providing a mezzanine tranche yielding a 17% annual percentage rate (APR). Senior loans are managed by Fasanara Capital, ensuring robust financial oversight and additional security for our investors.

## The Future of Untangled

Looking ahead, Untangled is set to expand its portfolio of offerings. With access to over 140 fintech lenders, rigorously vetted over a period of 6 to 8 months by Fasanara, we are continually enhancing our pool of assets. Future projects include the Fasanara Diversified Fund on-chain and senior notes backed by Eastern European invoice finance assets.
At Untangled, we're not just creating investment opportunities—we're building a foundation for sustainable economic growth, powered by blockchain technology and secured by real-world assets.
