# Securitization on blockchain

Securitization in the financial market involves bundling financial assets, like loans, into tradable securities, typically bonds, to enhance liquidity. These securities represent a claim on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets, allowing investors to buy and sell them on secondary markets. 
To bring this concept to blockchain, each real-world asset is tokenized into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) which represents the asset on blockchain. The NFT is evaluated. The asset originator can use it as a collateral asset to borrow from a Lending pool, and then repay the principal and interest accrued over time.
Investors who provide liquidity to the pool hold the pool note tokens, which has the APY accumulated in their price. Investors can withdraw their investment from the pool when the debt is repaid and get the profit.

## Key terms
### Lending pool (or pool)
Untangled lending pools are written as smart contracts on blockchain and they operate the same way how traditional securitization pools work, but they also have differences:
Tokenized assets provide transparency to the investors. They can track the financial transactions on chain and see what assets are pledged for financing, how much has been financed and how much repaid, which assets are repaid in due and which overdue.
The pool life cycle is not fixed. Investors can invest any time as long as the note sale is open and capacity not reached and originators can get financed any time as long as the liquidity is available. 
### Tranches
Investors can choose to invest in either senior or junior tranches based on your risk tolerance and return objectives. Senior tranches are for those seeking stable income streams with lower risk, while junior tranches are for those willing to accept higher risk in exchange for potentially higher returns.

- SOT or Senior Obligation Token represent the senior tranche in the pool. SOT token holders earn a fixed interest rate through the increase in SOT token prices (interest accruals)
- JOT or Junior Obligation Token represent the junior tranche (or unitranche) in the pool. JOT token holders earn a variable interest based on residual cash flow in a pool. A pool needs to maintain a minimum JOT amount as a minimum first loss.

SOT holders are prioritized for payment on withdrawal.
There is no duration for pool tokens, i.e., perpetual - as long as investors keep money in the pool they will earn interest from the underlying assets. Investment periods are however enforceable through off chain agreements.

### Issuer
Pool issuer refers to the entity responsible for creating and managing the pool of financial assets that will be securitized. In traditional finance, this issuer can be a financial institution, such as a bank or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) specifically established for the purpose of securitization. Things are similar on-chain as the issuer will be the entity to launch sale of note and define the pool note and asset configurations, which will be updated on chain to operate the pool.

### Asset Originator (or Originator)
Originator is the entity responsible for initially creating or acquiring the financial assets that will be securitized. This entity can be a bank, financial institution, or any organization that originates or holds the underlying assets, such as mortgages, auto loans, or credit card receivables. The asset originator may also be the same entity as the pool issuer or may work in conjunction with it. The role of the asset originator is to identify, underwrite, and package the assets into a pool that will serve as collateral for the securitization process. By transferring these assets into the pool, the asset originator pledges the asset as collateral and gets financed, based on the asset pricing. This allows the originator to free up capital and reduce exposure to the risks associated with holding these assets on its balance sheet.

### Asset Validator (or Validator)
Validator is an entity responsible for verifying the quality and authenticity of the assets included in the securitization pool. This validator plays a crucial role in ensuring that the assets meet the required standards and criteria set forth for tokenization. The pool contracts require Validator signature on-chain to mint the pool assets as Loan Assets Tokens (LAT).

### Liquidity provider (or Investor)
Liquid providers or Investor are those who provide liquidity to the pool. Investor can invest in senior or junior tranche, depending on how they structure their portfolio. While SOT can have limited sale time if SOT sale is Dutch auction, JOT is open for sale until the investment capacity is fulfilled.
