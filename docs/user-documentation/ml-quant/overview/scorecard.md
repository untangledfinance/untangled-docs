# Scorecard and Simulation

In the realm of decentralized finance, the Untangled Scorecard and Simulation feature serves indispensable purposes, addressing critical needs in the dynamic landscape. Here are three key reasons why this tool is essential:

## Validate Assumptions and Downstream Impacts with High-Scale Simulations

Assumptions are the foundation of any system, but their validity needs rigorous testing. Untangled provides a unique capability to validate assumptions and assess downstream impacts through high-scale, multi-agent simulations. By replicating a multitude of scenarios and market conditions, users can gain insights into the robustness of their systems at scale. This validation process not only ensures that assumptions hold under various conditions but also helps in fine-tuning strategies to adapt to a dynamic and ever-changing market landscape.

## Ensuring Resistance to Market-Based Attacks in Any Environment

Building trust in a decentralized financial ecosystem is paramount. Untangled's Scorecard and Simulation feature instills confidence by allowing users to assess whether what they are building will withstand market-based attacks in any environment. By simulating real-world market conditions and stress-testing against potential attacks, users can confidently deploy their systems, knowing they have undergone rigorous testing that mirrors the complexities of live environments. This trust is essential for users, developers, and the broader community, fostering resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges.
