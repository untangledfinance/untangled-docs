# Welcome to Untangled 

Untangled Finance build and execute yield strategies through our in-house credit investment management,risk modelling and smart contract capabilities:

### Proven credit strategies
Backed by Fasanara Capital, a leading institutional asset manager and a fintech investing pioneer, we specialise in creating on-chain credit and delta-neutral yield strategies involving both RWAs and crypto natives.

### Superior risk monitoring

We transform data on risk, security and protocol incentives, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, into powerful analytics, real-time monitoring and risk oracles, delivering custom risk data and reserve validation via zero-knowledge proof.

### Robust credit infrastructure

We designed and built Untangled Pool, a RWA tokenisation issuance and distribution platform focusing on private credits and Untangled Vault, a non-custodial, automated portfolio management tool for DAO treasuries and institutions.

## Products

Complementary credit infrastructure solutions: Untangled Pool, Untangled Vault and Credio

### Untangled Pool
Tokenization platform focusing on private credits: Short-term assets such as working capital for SMEs or trade finance are tokenized into NFTs, providing collateral backing in a transparent manner.

Investors hold a unitranche, JOT or a senior tranche SOT, according to their risk appetite.
We work with DAO treasuries and institutions to construct and execute non-custodial credit and yield strategies that safely incorporate both RWAs and bluechip crypto natives to suit investors' risk/return appetite.


### Untangled Vault 
Non-custodial, data-driven, automated, risk-first portfolio management solution catering for any risk/return appetite by DAO treasuries and institutional investors.

Built on tokenized vault and Safe smart account technologies, Untangled Vault attracts liquidity and invests cross-chain in both RWAs and crypto-native yield opportunities.

### Credio 
Risk analytics, simulation and monitoring solution powering both Untangled Pool and Untangled Vault, unlocking real-time risk management delivered through zero-knowledge proof.

Risk oracle feeding machine learning model inferences and custom data points directly to smart contracts in a decentralised, automated and privacy-preserving manner.
