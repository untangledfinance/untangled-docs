# Unique Identity

## What is UID?
To ensure the integrity of our protocol remains uncompromised, it is mandatory for all users to undergo our Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. This crucial step not only confirms your identity but also grants you the privilege to mint a distinctive Non-Fungible Token (NFT), referred to as a Unique Identity (UID). 
Your UID is an ERC-1155 NFT, a key that enables you to participate in the Untangled lending protocol. This digital asset serves as your verified identity within our ecosystem.
### Our KYC Process
The KYC verification is conducted through our trusted identity verification partner, Shuftipro (https://shuftipro.com)  ensuring a seamless and secure process. Importantly, no personal information is stored on-chain, maintaining your privacy and security.
### KYC Requirements for Different Investor Types
Investment opportunities on the Untangled Protocol are open to accredited investors and entities only. For legal and compliance reasons, we have tailored the KYC requirements to accommodate four distinct types of investors:
1. Non-US individual
2. Non-US entity
3. US individual
4. US entity
