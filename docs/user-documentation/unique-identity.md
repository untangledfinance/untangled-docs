# Unique Identity

## What is UID?
To ensure the integrity of our protocol remains uncompromised, it is mandatory for all users to undergo our Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. This crucial step not only confirms your identity but also grants you the privilege to mint a distinctive Non-Fungible Token (NFT), referred to as a Unique Identity (UID). 
Your UID is an ERC-1155 NFT, a key that enables you to participate in the Untangled lending protocol. This digital asset serves as your verified identity within our ecosystem.
### Our KYC Process
The KYC verification is conducted through our trusted identity verification partner, Shuftipro (https://shuftipro.com)  ensuring a seamless and secure process. Importantly, no personal information is stored on-chain, maintaining your privacy and security.
### KYC Requirements for Different Investor Types
Investment opportunities on the Untangled Protocol are open to accredited investors and entities only. For legal and compliance reasons, we have tailored the KYC requirements to accommodate four distinct types of investors:
1. Non-US individual
2. Non-US entity
3. US individual
4. US entity

## Onboarding

To start using the Untangled Investor App, follow these simple steps:
- Go to https://app.untangled.finance.
- Click the "Connect Wallet" button located at the top right corner.
- Select your preferred wallet service from MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet. This will be the wallet you use for transactions and investments on Untangled.

Remember, you can switch your connected wallet anytime. However, each new wallet address requires a separate KYC verification.

Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) are individuals or entities that ultimately own or control a customer or entity, typically through direct or indirect ownership of a significant percentage of the shares or voting rights. This can also include those who benefit from the entity or have the ultimate control over the management and operations. In most jurisdictions, the threshold for significant ownership is often set at 25% or more of the shares or voting rights, but this can vary.

## Generate Identity Passport
As an Individual or Entity investor, if you're seeing this screen, congratulations! You're verified and can now mint your UID at no extra charge from Untangled. Remember, while minting is free, you'll need to cover a small amount of the network’s gas fee, so ensure you have enough CELO/USDC  in your wallet for the transaction.
![UID minted txn](./img/kyc/uid-minted.png)
Once your UID is minted, you can now explore pools and make your first investment!
