For users who already familiar with crypto crurrency and have their asset on other network like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, etc. we suggested that you should use [Squid Router](https://app.squidrouter.com/) or [PortalBridge by Wormhole](https://portalbridge.com/) to transfer your asset to Celo Network.

With Squid Router, users can also swap their asset to CELO while bridging it to Celo network. An example of [swapping USDC from Ethereum to Celo naitive USDC](https://app.squidrouter.com/?chains=1%2C42220&tokens=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48%2C0xcebA9300f2b948710d2653dD7B07f33A8B32118C):

Here is another example where we [swap ETH on Ethereum to CELO on Celo](https://app.squidrouter.com/?chains=1%2C42220&tokens=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE%2C0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438):

Meanwhile, PortalBridge offer wrapped token transfer. Which means that on the destination chain, you will receive a Wormhole wrapped token of the asset that you sent on the original chain:

With this wrapped token, you can swap it into the non wrapped token using Uniswap. Here is an example of [Wormhole wrapped USDC to Celo native USDC](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/celo/0x37f750b7cc259a2f741af45294f6a16572cf5cad?chain=celo) on Uniswap:
